# SimpleCaptcha v1.0
Simple captcha without PHP.

Using just HTML and JS. It's __*vulnerable*__ (obviously), but it surely gets the things done for a simple project.

For a demo, you can watch the video I made **[right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EsiEcu7v0A)**.

### Using this piece of program

There are **3** files in the directory, namely, captcha.(css, html, js).

1. Copy the CSS and JS files into your HTML directory (not necessary, but makes things _simpler_).
2. Include these both into your HTML file. (If you're not sure how to do so, check [captcha.html](captcha.html))
3. In your HTML, run the function `check()` whenever you want to check the input field and to change the redirection page, go
to the JS file.
4. Be sure to **disable** the input field of the Captcha display box.
